# Bridge

> The Unoffical Venture For America (VFA) Social App

See also: Bridge API [here](https://github.com/jamespeacock/bridge_api)

# Mission

The goal of Bridge is to break silos and reduce fragmentation between VFA's fellows, who are seperated by city, class, and social group. We want to create a minimalistic, simple database of fellows, with some additional awesome features. 

This application is not oficially associated with VFA. It's made by and for fellows! 

# Problem Statement

It's tough to meet, know, and get stories of everyone at TC.
