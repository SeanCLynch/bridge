# Bridge

> The Unoffical Venture For America (VFA) Social App

See also: Bridge API [here](https://github.com/jamespeacock/bridge_api)

# Mission

The goal of Bridge is to break silos and reduce fragmentation between VFA's fellows, who are seperated by city, class, and social group. We want to create a minimalistic, simple database of fellows, with some additional awesome features. The broader goal of "The Bridge Project," of which the app is a core product, is to experiment with different forms of culture design and network formation in entrepreneurial environments beginning with VFA. 

This application is not oficially associated with VFA. It's made by and for fellows! 

# Problem Statement

What kind of fellow community should we design to achieve our full potential as entrepreneurs?
