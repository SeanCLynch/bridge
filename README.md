# Mission

The goal of Bridge is to break silos and reduce fragmentation between VFA Fellows. We want to create a minimalistic, simple database of people, with some additional useful features. 

This application is not associated with VFA.

# Problem Statement

It's tough to meet, know, and get stories of everyone at TC.
