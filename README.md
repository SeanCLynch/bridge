# Bridge

> The Unoffical VFA Social App

# Mission

The goal of Bridge is to break silos and reduce fragmentation between VFA Fellows. We want to make a minimalistic, simple database of people, with some additional useful features. 

We are not associated with VFA.

# Problem Statement

It's tough to meet, know, get stories of everyone at TC.
